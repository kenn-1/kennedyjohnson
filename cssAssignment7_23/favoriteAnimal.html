    <h2> Panda </h2>
    <div class="firstparagraph">
    <p> Giant pandas have a distinctive appearance. Their thick black and white fur equips
     them for life in cool forests. Their white coat with black markings is unique, with black patches round the eyes and ears, black legs, and 
    a black band around the shoulders.Pandas are "lazy", eating and sleeping make their day.
<span class="span1">An adult can eat 12â€“38 kilos of bamboo per day!</span> It's my favorite animal because they are cute and I always wanted to touch one. I also love 
their unique fur coloring.</p>
